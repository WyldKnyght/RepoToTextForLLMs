# Initial Cleanup
- Created 'src' and 'docs' folder
 - src/: Contains your source code files.
 - docs/: Contains your documentation files.
 - config/: Contains configuration files.

- Moved main code into src folder

- Added .gitignore for python
 - .gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

- Added LICENSE MIT License, make sure to go in and add your name
 - LICENSE: Specifies the licensing information for your project.

- Added Requirements.txt

# Intial Code Analysis
- Separate Functions in individual scripts.

- Added .env_temp file with GITHUB Token, and updated instructions

## get_readme_content.py
- Specify the exception type: 
    Catch a more specific exception to avoid hiding other unexpected issues.
- Use a common exception for API calls: 
    Assuming repo.get_contents might raise a specific exception when the file is not found, such as FileNotFoundError.

This change makes the error handling more precise and the code behavior clearer, as it explicitly handles the case where the README file does not exist. 
This avoids catching unintended exceptions that should be handled differently or should propagate up the call stack.

## traverse_repo_iteratively.py
Separate Concerns: 
    Decouple the progress display logic from the directory traversal logic to make the code cleaner and more modular.
Simplify Directory Management: 
    Use a more straightforward approach for managing directories to visit, ensuring that the code remains easy to understand without deep nesting or manual stack management.

The changes focus on making the code more modular by separating the progress display from the core logic of directory traversal. 
This separation makes the code easier to maintain and modify in the future. 
The traversal logic itself remains largely unchanged, but the progress display now wraps the entire loop rather than individual items, simplifying the interaction between tqdm and the directory processing. 
This change enhances readability and maintainability without altering the functionality.

## get_file_contents_iteratively.py
- Extract the list of binary file extensions into a configuration file named binary_extensions.txt 
- Created a loading function load_binary_extensions.py

### process_file.py
- Extracted file processing into process_file, making the main loop cleaner and focusing it on directory traversal.
- Consolidating Conditional Checks: The checks for binary file and missing encoding are handled with early returns, which simplifies the flow of the function.
- Using Early Returns: This approach minimizes the nesting of conditions, making the function easier to read and maintain.
- String Formatting: Using f-strings instead of concatenation enhances readability and reduces the chance of errors in string construction.

### decode_content.py
- Introduced a helper function that tries to decode content with multiple encodings, simplifying error handling and making the code more modular.
- Uses os.path.join for path construction, which is a more robust and cross-platform way to handle file paths. This also makes the code cleaner and less error-prone when dealing with file system paths.
- Use codecs module for decoding: Python's codecs module can be used to try decoding with multiple encodings in a cleaner way by leveraging its built-in error handling.
- Simplify the function structure: By using a helper function from the codecs module, we can eliminate the manual loop and exception handling, making the code more concise and readable.

### traverse_directory.py
- Split the directory traversal and file processing into separate functions. This will make the code more modular and easier to understand.
- Replaced the manual stack with a recursive function for directory traversal. This leverages Python's call stack to handle the directory depth, simplifying the code.
- Integrated file processing directly within the recursive function when a file is encountered, avoiding the need to manage file contents aggregation manually.

## get_repo_contents.py
- Move the creation of the instructions string to a separate function to make the get_repo_contents function cleaner and more focused on its primary task.
- Using urlparse from the urllib.parse module simplifies handling URLs by automatically managing different parts of the URL, making the code more robust and readable.
- Directly using os.getenv with a default value simplifies the environment variable fetching process.
- Consolidating print statements reduces clutter and improves the readability of the output, making it easier to track the progress of the function.

### create_instructions.py
Convert the manually concatenated instruction strings into a single multiline string to reduce the complexity and improve readability.
